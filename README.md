## Hi there, I'm Trenton 👋

I'm a software developer focused on document processing, DevOps automation, and building tools that make developers' lives easier. I'm passionate about open source and creating robust, well-tested Python applications.

### What I'm Working On

**Core Contributor**: [paperless-ngx](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx) - A community-supported supercharged version of paperless, a document management system that transforms your physical documents into a searchable online archive. I help maintain and develop features for this project, which has thousands of users worldwide.
